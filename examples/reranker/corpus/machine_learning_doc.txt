Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time through experience.

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Common supervised learning tasks include classification (predicting categories) and regression (predicting continuous values). Popular algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Clustering algorithms like k-means group similar data points together, while dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA help visualize high-dimensional data. Association rule learning discovers relationships between different variables.

Reinforcement learning trains agents to make sequential decisions by learning from rewards and penalties. The agent explores an environment, takes actions, and receives feedback to maximize cumulative reward. This approach has been successful in game playing, robotics, and autonomous systems.

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns. Convolutional neural networks excel at image recognition, recurrent neural networks handle sequential data like text and speech, and transformer architectures have revolutionized natural language processing.

Key concepts in machine learning include feature engineering, cross-validation, overfitting, underfitting, bias-variance tradeoff, and model evaluation metrics. Data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning are crucial steps in building effective machine learning models.

In machine learning, a neural network (also artificial neural network or neural net, abbreviated ANN or NN) is a computational model inspired by the structure and functions of biological neural networks.[1][2]

A neural network consists of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in the brain. Artificial neuron models that mimic biological neurons more closely have also been recently investigated and shown to significantly improve performance. These are connected by edges, which model the synapses in the brain. Each artificial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons. The "signal" is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs, called the activation function. The strength of the signal at each connection is determined by a weight, which adjusts during the learning process.
