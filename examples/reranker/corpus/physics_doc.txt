Physics is the fundamental science that seeks to understand how the universe works at all scales, from subatomic particles to galaxies. It studies matter, energy, motion, forces, space, and time, providing the foundation for all other natural sciences and many technological advances.

Classical mechanics, developed by Newton, describes the motion of objects from projectiles to planets. It includes concepts like force, momentum, energy, and conservation laws. These principles govern everything from car engines to spacecraft trajectories and remain accurate for everyday-scale phenomena.

Thermodynamics deals with heat, temperature, and energy transfer. The four laws of thermodynamics govern how energy flows and transforms, explaining everything from steam engines to the heat death of the universe. Concepts like entropy help us understand the direction of time and the efficiency limits of machines.

Electromagnetism unifies electricity and magnetism into a single theory. Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields interact and propagate as electromagnetic waves, including light, radio waves, and X-rays. This theory enabled the development of modern electronics and telecommunications.

Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales. Unlike classical physics, quantum systems exhibit wave-particle duality, uncertainty principles, and superposition. These strange properties enable technologies like lasers, transistors, and quantum computers.

Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Special relativity shows that space and time are intertwined and that nothing can travel faster than light. General relativity describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime and predicts phenomena like black holes and gravitational waves.

Modern physics continues to push boundaries with particle physics exploring fundamental constituents of matter, condensed matter physics investigating complex materials, and cosmology studying the origin and evolution of the universe. These fields drive innovations in technology, medicine, and our understanding of nature.
