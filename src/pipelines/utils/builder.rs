//! Shared builder patterns for pipeline construction.
//!
//! This module provides common traits and implementations that eliminate code duplication
//! across different pipeline builders. Most pipeline builders follow a similar pattern:
//! 1. Store model options and device request
//! 2. Implement device selection methods via `DeviceSelectable`
//! 3. Build the pipeline by resolving device, creating model from cache, and getting tokenizer
//!
//! The `BasePipelineBuilder` trait captures this common pattern.

/// A trait that captures the common pipeline building pattern.
///
/// Most pipeline builders follow these steps:
/// 1. Resolve the device request to an actual device
/// 2. Generate a cache key from model options and device
/// 3. Get or create the model from the global cache
/// 4. Get the tokenizer for the model
/// 5. Construct the final pipeline with model and tokenizer
///
/// This trait provides a default implementation of this pattern while allowing
/// customization through the associated methods.
